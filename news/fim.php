                        FIM stands for Functional Independence Measure, which is a widely used assessment tool to measure the functional status of patients in rehabilitation settings. It consists of 18 items that evaluate a patient's ability to perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, grooming, and mobility. Scores range from 18 (complete dependence) to 126 (complete independence), with higher scores indicating greater independence. FIM is used to track a patient's progress over time and to determine appropriate levels of care and rehabilitation services.
